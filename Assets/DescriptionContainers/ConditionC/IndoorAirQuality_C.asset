  text: "Indoor air quality data, including measures such as CO\u2082, temperature,
    humidity, VOCs, and PM2.5, is used to adjust ventilation and airflow in response
    to conditions inside the building, such as room usage or measured air quality
    levels. Sharing this data may allow inferences about space usage patterns, including
    when rooms are occupied or how frequently specific areas are used. "
