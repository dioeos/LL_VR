  text: 'Bluetooth proximity data, including signals from nearby devices that indicate
    closeness to certain areas or objects, allows the building to respond to presence
    near certain areas, such as triggering access or automated systems.  Sharing
    this data may allow inferences about location within the building and interactions
    with specific spaces or entry points.
